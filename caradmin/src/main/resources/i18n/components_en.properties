instructions_body_orgpol_edit=<p>Institutional policies reflect your organization's intent with respect to the use of personal information in various situations.</p><p>For a given transaction, institutional policies may be controlling or may be presented as "institutional recommendations" to end users during consent interactions.</p><p>Institutional policies contain three primary elements:</p><ul class="simple-list"><li><strong>Relying Party Restriction</strong> - describes which relying parties the policy is applicable to.  Some policies may apply to all relying parties, while others may apply to a single relying party or a set of relying parties identified by a regular expression match against an RP property.</li><li><strong>User Restriction</strong> - describes which users the policy is applicable to.  Some policies may apply to all users, while others may apply only to those users with specific characteristics.</li><li><strong>Directives</strong> - describe the actual decisions to render for specific items with specific values when requested by applicable relying parties regarding applicable users.</li></ul><p>Recording a Lawful Basis for each directive allows CAR to provide GDPR and other privacy compliance reports as needed.</p><p><strong>Note</strong> that selecting "Consent" as the basis for a directive does <strong>NOT</strong> automatically apply a matching meta policy to enforce consent -- be sure to adjust meta policies as necessary when employing consent.</p><p><strong>Note also</strong> that setting a "permit" or "deny" directive for "all other items" will prevent any lower-priority policies that might otherwise apply from being used when rendering decisions.</p>
