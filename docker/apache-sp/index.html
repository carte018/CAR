<b>Welcome to Amber -- the fictitious world of the CAR demo environment!</b>
<br>
This demo environment comprises a complete and fully functioning CAR instance providing attribute release decisions to a Shibboleth IDP that's bilaterally federated with a set of four additional relying parties.

<h2>Set up your test accounts</h2>
If you're new here, you might want to start by creating a set of test users for yourself.  As you use the various test services in the Sliced Bread environment, you'll
necessarily make persistent changes to the privacy settings of the users you log in with.  To avoid confusion when multiple people are interacting with the environment, 
you should set up a collection of personal test users for yourself.  It's quick and easy -- just visit:
<ul>
<li><a href="/ldap" target="_blank">Test Account Creation</a></li>
</ul>
and supply a first and middle initial and a last name -- we'll take care of the rest!
</div>

Once you have some test users to authenticate with, you can visit:
<h2>Relying Parties</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/contentrus" target="_blank">Content-R-Us (simulating a commercial content provider)</a></li>
<li><a href="/randsrus" target="_blank">RandS-R-Us (simulating a support service for research and scholarship)</a></li>
<li><a href="/scholars" target="_blank">The Scholarly Garage (simulating an intra-institutional scholarship resource -- eg., a library)</a></li>
<li><a href="/payroll" target="_blank">Peanuts -- the Amber Payroll System</a></li>
</ul>
Also try out CAR's end user self-service features at:
