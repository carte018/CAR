For various reasons, you may want or need to establish  preferences for a site or service without actually visiting it -- for example, you might  need to set preferences for the use of your personal information before a service tries  to access it in your absence.  Listed here are all the sites and services for which you  don't currently have specific preferences specified.  Click the "Add" link next to any  one of them will take you into an editor where you can specify your specific preferences  for that site.
